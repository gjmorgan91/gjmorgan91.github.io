					<h5>User Study</h5>
					<p>We began our process through a need finding study aimed towards dog owners. We conducted 3 interviews to develop personas to use throughout our design process.</p>
					<div class="row subsection pocketpup">
						<div class="col s12 m12 l4">
							<h6><b>Jamison and Madix</b></h6>
							<p>Jamison, age 22, has a 2 year old german shepheard named Madix. Jamison enjoys training his dog, he feels it establishes a better relationship with them. He has problems with his dog towards some smaller ones and wants to break this behavior.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col s12 m12 l4">
							<h6><b>Andrew and Odin</b></h6>
							<p>Andrew, age 27, has a 1.5 year old huskie named Odin. Odin is less responsive to Andrew's commands and lacking some training. He enjoys playing with his dog and sees less benefit from continuous training.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col s12 m12 l4">
							<h6><b>Kevin and Athena</b></h6>
							<p>Kevin, age 42, has a 7 year old doberman named Athena. He is not proficcient with using technology, and his dog tends to be rather antisocial. However, she is very responsive to him, and they share a strong bond.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<h6>The problem:</h6>
						<p>Through our user study, we identified a common thread between our three personas; when faced with a problem regarding their dog (ie: training, dietary, ect), they had no means of preparing themselves beforehand. That is to say, all training was done after the problem had occurred.</p>

					<h5>Product</h5>
					<p>Throughout our process, we decided on Pocket Pup. We were given an additional studio-imposed constraint of developing a game experience. Aimed to help owns, Pocket Pup allows a user to add their own dog's likeness into the game. Adding their dog's metrics (age, weight, breed, ect), Pocket Pup will simulate scenarios likely to occur for that owner.</p>

					<h5>Critique</h5>
					<p>The greatest limitation we faced throughout this project was our learning curve as this was the first use of web development practices for our group. However, there were areas of improvement which we could have addressed still.</p>
					<div class="subsection pocketpup">
						<h6>Information</h6>
						<p>We wanted to give a resource for the owners to answer any and all questions they may have. This lead us to decisions about adding in aspects like the park finder, training videos, and the training library. While these are important for pet training, they did not become incorporated in the application in a way which fit the context. The training information is demonstrated through event based interactions in the game as the virtual pet faces the challenges real pet owners find themselves in. All our training information should have been integrated in this format.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="subsection pocketpup">
						<h6>Interface</h6>
						<p>A better approach than the tradition UI we adopted would have been to integrate the navigation to the various pages into the environment. This would have allowed us to challenge ourselves to build a smarter system for the UI but also to free space on the screen in order to not occlude the environment which all our primary interactions would take place.</p>
