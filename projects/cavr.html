				<h3>the event</h3>
				<p>A collaboration between an archaeological research division on UCSD aimed at preserving many of the Earth's oldest treasures through sustainable techniques and one of UCSD's fast-growing student organizations lead to an event which allowed students to develop virtual reality applications with the goal of educating users on sustainable practices for archaeological sites. Students were given access to a virtual reality lab with all the equipment they would need, as well as they were provided point-cloud data of real archaeological sites.</p>

				<h3>my contributions</h3>
				<div class="grid col2">
					<div>
						<p>I provided the event with a simple brand including a logo and graphics to use for the advertising of the event as well as a sticker design to be distributed at the event.</p>
						<p>The logo was designed to blend the ideas of the point-cloud representations of archaeological sites. Sticking to a simple, figure-ground design, I designed the logo as a piece of architecture similar to ones the event holders help to document. Using voids of the cloud forms, I interpolated missing piece of the forms. Given the uses of the logo, there was not a strong need to make it highly scalable, so some, smaller details were included in it.</p>
						<p>The sticker was designed around the trend for hackathon stickers using a hexagonal die cut. To aid in the printing process, a textural element of paper for the background was added to the brand as a whole which gave contrast against the graphic.</p>
						<p>The banner was designed around typical specs for a facebook banner in terms of height and width. The point-cloud motif used on the logo became part of the background of the banner in order to add more visual weight to the piece altogether.</p>
